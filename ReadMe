The dataset used in this project is the SEWA dataset, which is a private dataset that requires an End User License Agreement (EULA) for access. The dataset consists of video recordings and corresponding arousal values. The arousal values are used to classify whether the subject is attentive or not. The dataset is preprocessed to ensure balanced sampling of attentive and non-attentive frames.

You can install the required packages using the following command:

pip install torch torchvision timm opencv-python pandas numpy tqdm
